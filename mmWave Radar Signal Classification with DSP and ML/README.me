## ðŸ“¡ Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying moving objects (Cars, Drones, and People) using **mmWave radar spectrogram data**. The radar data is processed using **CFAR (Constant False Alarm Rate) detection** and includes range-Doppler matrices representing detected objects. 

We implemented a **Random Forest classifier** to automatically recognize targets based on their radar return signatures, combining **Digital Signal Processing (DSP)** techniques with **machine learning**.

## ðŸ§  Methodology

### Data
- Radar spectrograms captured via **FMCW radar** and labeled into three classes:
  - `Cars`
  - `Drones`
  - `People`
- Each radar sample is a **11x61 matrix** representing the range-Doppler map.

### Preprocessing Pipeline
- **Wavelet Denoising** (Daubechies wavelet + soft thresholding)
- **Median Filtering** (3x3 kernel)
- **Min-Max Normalization** to [0, 1] scale
- **Cropped matrices** to retain original **11x61** shape.

### Feature Engineering
- Flattened **11x61 matrices** into **671-dimensional feature vectors**.
- No handcrafted features required as Random Forest handles high-dimensional input well.

### Model
- **Random Forest Classifier**:
  - `n_estimators=100`
  - `max_depth=20`
  - Trained on an 80/20 train-test split.
  
### Visualizations
- **Feature Importance Heatmap**: Shows which Doppler and range bins were most influential.
- **Prediction Showcase**: 10 randomly selected CFAR samples, color-coded with prediction confidence bars.

## Results
- Prediction Accuracy of over 91%
- Achieved strong classification results across **Cars**, **Drones**, and **People** classes.
- Identified key Doppler zones responsible for target differentiation.
